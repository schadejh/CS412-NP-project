problem description
Max Clique
given an undirected graph, find the largest subset S,
such that for each member of S, there is an edge to
all other members of S.
Return one maximal clique, even if there are multiple.
The decision variant of this problem tests if there is a clique
of size k, returning true if so, false if not.

program input format
an undirected graph, G = (V), in the format of a dictionary
V1 = v1, v2,...
