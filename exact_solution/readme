Hi Dr Malloy,


I'm editing this because I realized the format in which I submitted my individual work does not exactly align with the specifications you outlined in the project description.  

For clarification:


the file cs412_maxClique_exact.py is my exact solution code.

the file input_file.txt contains sample inputs that are run by my shell script

the file shelscript.sh is my shell script which runs the inputs on my input_file.txt file. shelscript.sh also contains a series of test cases with their expected outputs commented next to them. 



to run my code with custom input, simply type 
/your-file-path/cs412_maxClique_exact.py or press the run button on vs-code/eclipse

then type an input formated with the first line indicating the number of edges, and all lines after describing each edge once

here's a triangle for example:

3
a b
b c
c a

The expected output is {a, b, c}



to run the shellscript, simply type 

chmod +x shelscript.sh

then type:

./shelscript.sh 



Everything else in this file I sumbitted 1 day late, but as we discussed during your office hours, I am going to apply my last late day for that. 
This readme file I am submitting 3 days late, so you are feee to doc me late points on this.
